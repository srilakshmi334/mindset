Today, I played "dot, dot, dot..." and I improved my score from 150
to 200 clicks in 30 seconds! I've been seeing amazing
improvements in my ability to move and think quicker; yesterday I 
I played tennis after a while and won 3 games consecutively
because I was so alert!

Reflection 2 - 04/06/2023
Today, I played "do you remember?" and for a typical card game, I
didn't expect myself to struggle with finding the matching pairs! 
I'm learning that I need to boost my short-term memory, but at
least it'll be in time for my exams!

Reflection 1 - 28/05/2023
I just started using mindset and that word unscrambling game,
I was surprised, it was more fun than I thought. I've never been
a great speller but I can see this game definitely improving my
language and speech recognition!
