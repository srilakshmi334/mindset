
Hey, welcome to mindset!

A project inspired by those days where your brain just hurts too
much to work, and created by us young STEM entrepreneurs, we
are excited to present to you, our first ever mobile app!

Optimal brain function refers to the ability for an individual to
maximize the cognitive efficiency of their brain in areas such as
the hippocampus, cerebellum, and cerebrum. 

Encouraging your inner child, we have created simple visual
games that strengthen these areas, keeping in mind that you're
busy, and your time matters.

With each new game, you will be able to unlock new information
areas about the brain as well as the opportunity to add
activity reflections both before and after the game is completed.

Each game has different modes so feel free to work at your own pace and 
a live tracker will be available to remind you of your amazing
progress. We've even added guided relaxation activities just to
remind you to give yourself a break.

Thanks for sticking with us, we can't wait for you to begin your
new journey with mindset.
